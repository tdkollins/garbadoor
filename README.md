## How does it work?

In a nutshell, we used Google's Machine Learning Vision API to recognize
the type of garbage, and sorted it with some arduino magic. During this time,
we kept track of some neat statistics with a firebase database for city maitenance.

That was just the quick rundown, but please checkout the devpost for more information!
